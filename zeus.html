            <h2>Analysis: Ancient vs. Modern</h2>
            <div class="comparison">
                <div class="comparison-item">
                    <h4>Authority</h4>
                    <p><strong>Ancient:</strong> Absolute, unquestioned ruler of all</p>
                    <p><strong>Modern:</strong> Often flawed, questioned, or overthrown</p>
                </div>
                <div class="comparison-item">
                    <h4>Power</h4>
                    <p><strong>Ancient:</strong> Supreme cosmic force</p>
                    <p><strong>Modern:</strong> Increasingly mortal or defeatable</p>
                </div>
                <div class="comparison-item">
                    <h4>Symbolism</h4>
                    <p><strong>Ancient:</strong> Justice, order, divine authority</p>
                    <p><strong>Modern:</strong> Ambition, excess, warning against tyranny</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Modern portrayals of Zeus and other Greek gods blend timeless mythological roles with evolving values. While ancient myths emphasized absolute authority, cosmic power, and divine justice, modern stories often humanize these gods, highlighting their flaws and vulnerabilities. This reflects contemporary skepticism toward unchecked power and explores themes of ambition, hubris, and the consequences of leadership. Symbols like the thunderbolt and eagle remain powerful, but their meanings now include warnings against tyranny and the importance of balance.</p>

                <h2>Analysis: Ancient vs. Modern</h2>
                <div class="comparison">
                    <div class="comparison-item">
                        <h4>Warfare</h4>
                        <p><strong>Ancient:</strong> Athena was the goddess of strategic, intellectual combat, favoring cunning and planning over brute force. She guided heroes like Odysseus and influenced events such as the Trojan War with her wisdom.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern:</strong> Athena’s legacy lives on in metaphors for battles of justice, equality, and social progress. In films, literature, and activism, her name is invoked to represent thoughtful, principled action against injustice.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-item">
                        <h4>Gender Role</h4>
                        <p><strong>Ancient:</strong> Athena was a virgin goddess, independent and often associated with male domains like war and leadership. She challenged traditional gender roles but did not directly advocate for women’s rights in the ancient world.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern:</strong> Today, Athena is celebrated as a feminist icon, representing female empowerment, agency, and leadership. Her story inspires discussions about women breaking barriers and claiming autonomy in male-dominated fields.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-item">
                        <h4>Symbolism</h4>
                        <p><strong>Ancient:</strong> Athena’s symbols, the owl (wisdom), olive tree (gift to Athens), and shield (protection), represented civic virtue, craftsmanship, and intellectual strength in Greek culture.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern:</strong> These symbols are still used in education, technology, and branding to promote values like knowledge, innovation, and empowerment. Athena’s image is a shorthand for intellectual strength and strategic thinking in modern society.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Athena’s ancient attributes, wisdom, strategic warfare, and independence, continue to shape her modern legacy, but with new meanings that reflect contemporary values and concerns. Her enduring symbolism bridges classical mythology and current discussions about gender, power, and intellect.</p>

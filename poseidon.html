                    <p>In Hesiod’s Theogony, Poseidon is described as the earth-shaker and god of the sea, one of the sons of Cronus and Rhea, and brother to Zeus and Hades. After the overthrow of the Titans, Poseidon drew lots with his brothers and became ruler of the sea, while Zeus ruled the sky and Hades the underworld.</p>

                <h2>Analysis: Ancient vs. Modern</h2>
                <div class="comparison">
                    <div class="comparison-item">
                        <h4>Authority</h4>
                        <p><strong>Ancient:</strong> Poseidon is depicted as the supreme ruler of the seas and earthquakes, a figure whose authority is absolute and unquestioned among mortals and gods alike. He commands respect and fear, embodying the uncontrollable forces of nature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern:</strong> Contemporary portrayals often humanize Poseidon, showing him as flawed and subject to personal vendettas, emotional outbursts, and vulnerabilities as seen in Percy Jackson. This reflects a shift toward questioning authority and exploring the psychological dimensions of power.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-item">
                        <h4>Power</h4>
                        <p><strong>Ancient:</strong> Poseidon’s power is cosmic and unchallengeable. He can create or destroy with a gesture, shaping the world through storms, earthquakes, and the creation of horses.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern:</strong> While still portrayed as immensely powerful, modern stories frequently depict Poseidon as a force that can be resisted, outsmarted, or even overthrown by mortals or other gods, emphasizing themes of resilience and agency.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-item">
                        <h4>Symbolism</h4>
                        <p><strong>Ancient:</strong> Poseidon symbolizes justice, order, divine authority, and fertility, representing both the destructive and creative aspects of nature. His trident and association with horses and the sea reinforce these themes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern:</strong> Modern interpretations often use Poseidon to explore ambition, excess, and the dangers of unchecked power. His myths are reimagined to serve as cautionary tales about hubris and the consequences of leadership.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Modern portrayals of Poseidon blend timeless mythological roles with evolving values. While ancient myths emphasized his absolute authority and cosmic power, modern stories often highlight his flaws and vulnerabilities, reflecting contemporary skepticism toward unchecked power and exploring themes of ambition, consequences, and the humanization of the divine. Symbols like the trident and the horse remain potent, but their meanings now include warnings against tyranny and the importance of balance between power and responsibility.</p>
